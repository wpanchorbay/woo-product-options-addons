# OptionBay - Product Options and Addons

A production-ready WooCommerce extension that empowers store owners to offer advanced product customization, paid add-ons, and personalized services. Built with a lightning-fast React/TypeScript admin interface and a robust, highly optimized PHP backend.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛒 Storefront Experience
- **11 Custom Field Types**: Support for Text, Textarea, Number, Email, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Color Swatches, Image Swatches, and Static HTML.
- **Dynamic Pricing Engine**: Charge customers for add-ons using Flat Fees or Percentage-based calculations. Prices update instantly on the product page.
- **Conditional Logic**: Build smart, interactive forms. Show or hide fields dynamically based on the customer's previous selections.
- **Instant Hydration**: Field schemas and inventory data are injected directly into the frontend (no slow AJAX calls on page load), ensuring a lightning-fast user experience powered by vanilla JavaScript.
- **Shipping Weight Integration**: Add physical weight to options, which seamlessly integrates with WooCommerce shipping calculations.

### 🛡️ Admin & Architecture
- **Modern React SPA Builder**: A beautiful, drag-and-drop option builder inside the WordPress admin built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Global Inventory Management**: Unlike standard WooCommerce variations, OptionBay uses a custom database table (`wpab_product_options_addons_inventory`) to track stock across *multiple different products*.
- **High-Performance Assignments**: Uses a dedicated lookup table (`wpab_product_options_addons_assignments`) to instantly determine which option groups belong to which products, eliminating slow post-meta queries.
- **Data Portability**: Built-in Import/Export tools allow you to migrate complex option groups and inventory settings between staging and production sites instantly.
- **HPOS Ready**: Fully compatible with WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage.
